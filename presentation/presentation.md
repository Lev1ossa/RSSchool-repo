Hi, my name is Alex, i am student of Rolling Scopes School and today i want to tell you about React.

React is a frontend framework, that was developed and first used in 2011 in Facebook.
At start, React was closed tool for only Facebook company use, but in may 2013 it has become open source. At the beginning, the audience was skeptical, but through the year React popularity was growing, the community was active and did large amount of commits and created issues. 
Later, in 2015 was realized React Native, the tool for creating mobile and dekstop apps, that become very popular in a short period. 
And in 2018 was realized React hooks, that provides a way to manage state and side effects within functional components without the necessity to write classes. And because of open source nature and great community, React become better and provides more functionality every year.

So React is a tool to create user interfaces, that significantly changes the way of development. The advantages of react is:
Component-Based Architecture. Using React, developer split large app to small components, that are easy reusable in any part of app. You can add it in any part of app, delete it without affecting other components and reuse it as many time as you want. It makes app develop much more easier, then before.
Virtual DOM is the most important advantage of React, it is partial rendering of DOM tree according to each component own states. It makes it more faster and controlable, that vanilla JavaScript.
One-Way Data binding. It means that changing of some component data affects only this component and it's children with no affecting of parent and other components.
The next advantage is JSX, that provides to developer a way to write HTML-like code directly in JavaScript, using all of it's functionality and variables. This makes it easier to write and understand code.
Large community, that makes React better and better all the time.
Third-Party Libraries ecosystem, that helps developer and makes development proccess much more easier.

You need to understand, that JSX is not same as HTML code and have own features, like className instead of class, braces around JavaScript code, using object for style instead of string and other. 

As you can see on this graphs, React is the most popular frontend framework in the world and it's popularity still grows. At the end of 2022, React is almost 2 times more popular than the Angular or Vue.

It's easy to install, create first app and learn. npx create-react-app with name of app command creates app folder, base file structure, install base dependencies, babel, webpack and create base app files. You need just open the folder and run template app. After it, you can remove redundunt files, add your own base components and your base app is ready to develop. So you can start to develop new project in minutes. More information about react app building you can see on this link.

React has a plenty of tools and react libraries, that makes develop process easier. 
Redux or Context Api is a global state container, that allow to use one state all across the app. It allows to control any components from any part of app. As example, dark or light theme. You can set current value when app starts, toggle it from any part of app and be sure, that all components can use it.
React Router is a tool which provides an easy way to create single page application with clear browser navigation and easy way to work with adress bar. It very helpfull in single page application. User can directly access any of page that app have, can use browsers button back and forward and understand on which page his location is.
React native is a tool to create mobile and dekstop apps, using React. And you can easy migrate your React web app to other platforms. As example, one of the most popular chat and call app Discord is developed using React Native. 
Also React has a huge amount of small libraries, like ready to use functional components, UI elements, icons and other. In my projects i have used components like side bar, toasts, react icons, react hook forms and other. Also React have ready to use style libraries, like ANT design, that allow developer to create app with base design fast and easy.
 
Nowadays, more and more developers are using React to create new projects, and I am one of them. If you developing something more difficult then static web site, better to use React or one of other frameworks, then vanilla JavaScript or Typescript.
When working on our final project, my team used React. Some members of the team had no prior experience with the framework, while I had some limited experience. We learned as we worked on the project, and it did not hinder us from achieving a perfect score. This speaks to the ease of learning React, the detailed documentation, and the abundance of additional information available.
I'm going to learn React more and use it in every project i will make and recommend you to do the same. It makes development process easier, project structure clearer and conrolable.
Thank you for your attention.
